Introduction
The real estate market is one of the most significant parts/areas in the (process of people making, selling, and buying things). Property prices are influenced by many factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and market conditions. (very close to the truth or true number) property price (statement about a possible future event) is extremely important for real estate (people or businesses who give money to help start businesses), home buyers, and policymakers.
This project aims to develop a data-driven machine learning model to (describe a possible future event) housing prices. By taking advantage of historical real estate data, we identify key factors that influence pricing and provide (understandings of deep things) to Surprise Housing for better investment decisions.

2. Problem Statement
The first (or most important) goal of this project is to build a (describe a possible future event)ive model that guesses (numbers) property values based on historical housing data. The key goals include:
*. (describing a possible future event) property prices based on different features.
*. Identifying important (numbers that change/things that change) that drive house prices.
*. Helping Surprise Housing make (based on knowledge and learning) investment decisions.

3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
* Dataset Summary
The dataset consists of many features describing real estate properties, including:
-Location: City, neighborhood, zip code.
-Size: Square footage of the property.
-Bedrooms & Bathrooms: Number of rooms.
-Year Built: Age of the property.
-Market Conditions: Interest rates, money-based indicators.
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
* Handling Missing Values:
-Credited missing values using mean/mode for number-based features.
-Dropped unrelated/unimportant records with lots of missing data.
* (translating/putting into secret code) Categorical (numbers that change/things that change):
-Applied One-Hot (translating/putting into secret code) for categorical data (e.g., location, property type).
* Feature Scaling:
-(made something look or work the same way every time) number-based values using MinMaxScaler to (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ize the data.
* (something that's not part of the main group) Detection & Removal:
-Used box plots and IQR method to eliminate extreme (things that aren't part of the main group).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps in understanding data distribution, (popular things/general ways things are going), and relationships. Key (understandings of deep things):
* Visual Analysis
*. Price Distribution: Property prices are right-skewed, with some high-value (things that aren't part of the main group).
*. Relationship Analysis: Features like square footage, location, and number of bedrooms have a strong relationship with price.
*. (popular thing/general way things are going) Analysis: Newer properties tend to have higher values, but location remains the most in control/most common factor.
* Key Findings from EDA
-Properties in higher price/higher cost locations have much higher prices.
-Larger homes (in terms of square footage) generally have higher (figuring out how much money something is worth).
-Older properties tend to have (a) little lower market values.

5. Feature Engineering
To improve model performance, we created added/more features:
*. Price per Square Foot = Total Price / Square Video (More stable (describe a possible future event)or)
*. Age of Property = Current Year - Year Built
*. Nearby (nice things to have) Score = Based on school ratings, hospitals, and shopping centers
After feature selection, we kept only the most (clearly connected or related) features to avoid overfitting.

6. Model Selection and Training
We experimented with multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing one.
* Models Thought about/believed:
* Linear Moving backward - (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) model, assumes linear relationships.
* Decision Tree Move backwardor - Captures non-(being like a line), but likely to experience/likely to get overfitting.
* Random Forest Move backwardor - Handles non-(being like a line) well, reduces overfitting.
* XGBoost Move backwardor - Advanced boosting way of doing things, best for structured data.
* Model Training Process
-Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
-(made something look or work the same way every time) number-based features before training.
-Used cross-validation (CV=5) to secure/make sure of strong and healthy model performance.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve (as much as possible) model performance, we fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
* Best Hyperparameters Found:
*. Random Forest: n_estimators=200, max_depth=15, min_samples_split=5
*. XGBoost: learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=150, max_depth=6, subsample=0.8

8. Model (process of figuring out the worth, amount, or quality of something)
We (figured out the worth, amount, or quality of) models using key performance numbers that measure things:
*. Mean Squared Error (MSE) a' Measures average (statement about a possible future event) error.
*. R² Score a Decides/figures out how well the model explains variance in price.
*. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) a' Square root of MSE for better understand/explainability.
ModelMSE,RMSE,R² Score
Linear Moving backward 520002280.72
Decision Tree380001950.81
Random Forest290001700.89
XGBoost265001630.91
* Best Model:
-XGBoost performed the best with 91% (quality of being very close to the truth or true number) and the lowest error.

9. Feature Importance Analysis
The most important features for (describing a possible future event) house prices:
1) Location - Higher price/higher cost areas significantly hit/affect prices.
2) Square Video - Bigger properties = Higher price.
3) Number of Bedrooms - More bedrooms = Higher (figuring out the amount of money something is worth).
4) Nearby (nice things to have) - Schools, hospitals, and parks increase value.

10. Business Effects/results/suggestions
This model helps Surprise Housing in:
*. Better Investment Decisions - Focus on high-value locations.
*. Pricing (success plans/ways of reaching goals) - (describe a possible future event) property values with higher (quality of being very close to the truth or true number).
*. Market Trends - Identify (popular things/general ways things are going) to (make as big as possible) returns.

11. End/end result and Future Steps
* Key Things to remember
-Built a highly (very close to the truth or true number) (describe a possible future event)ive model for real estate prices.
-XGBoost was the best-performing model.
-Location & property size were the most important factors.
* Future Improvements
* Add more data (money-based conditions, mortgage rates).
* Try deep learning models for price (statement about a possible future event).
* Send out and use model via API or web computer program for (happening or viewable immediately, without any delay) (statements about possible future events).
